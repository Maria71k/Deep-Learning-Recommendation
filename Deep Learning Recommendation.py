import tensorflow as tf

# Build a deep learning model for recommendation (e.g., neural collaborative filtering, deep matrix factorization)
# (Implementation details may vary based on specific architecture and dataset)

# Example usage:
# - Train the model using historical user-item interactions
# - Make predictions for new user-item pairs to generate personalized recommendations
